## Introduction

Workspaces enable the governance of data & AI activation. Each workspace within an organization's account will have self-contained data sources, data & AI models, syncs and business application destinations.

### Key workspace concepts

- Organization: An AI Squared account that is a container for a set of workspaces.

- Workspace: Represents a set of users and resources. One or more workspaces are contained within an organization.

- User: An individual within a workspace, with a specific Role. A user can be a part of one or more workspaces.

- Role: Defined by a set of rules that govern a user’s access to resources within a workspace

- Resources: Product features within the workspace that enable the activation of data and AI. These include data sources, destinations, models, syncs, and more.

### Workspace settings

You can access Workspace settings from within Settings on the left navigation menu. The workspace’s name and description can be edited at any time for clarity.

### Inviting users to a workspace

You can view the list of active users on the Members tab, within Settings. Users can be invited or deleted from this screen.

To invite a user, enter their email ID and choose their role. The invited user will receive an email invite (with a link that will expire after 30 days).

### Role-based access control (RBAC)

Governance within workspaces is enabled by user Role-based access control (RBAC).

- **Admins** have unrestricted access to all resources in the Organization’s account and all its workspaces. Admins can also create workspaces and manage the workspace itself, including inviting users and setting user roles.

- **Members** belong to a single workspace, with access to all its resources. Members are typically part of a team or purpose that a workspace has been specifically set up for.

- **Viewers** have read-only access to core resources within a workspace. Viewers can’t manage the workspace itself or add users.

### Creating a new workspace

To create a workspace, use the drop-down on the left navigation panel that shows your current active workspace, click Manage Workspaces.
