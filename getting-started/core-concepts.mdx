Sources are the starting points of your data journey. It's where all your data is stored and where AI Squared pulls data from.

They can be defined through:

- **SQL Editor**: For customized queries
- **Visual Table Selector**: For intuitive interface
- **Existing dbt Models or Looker Looks**: Leveraging pre-built models

### Importance of a Unique Primary Key
Every model must have a unique primary key to ensure each data entry is distinct, crucial for data tracking and updating.

## Syncs: Customizing Data Flow

### Overview
'Syncs' in AI Squared helps you move data from sources to destinations. They help you in mapping the data from your models to the destination.

There are two types of syncs:
- **Full Refresh Sync**: All data is synced from the source to the destination.
- **Incremental Sync**: Only the new or updated data is synced.
