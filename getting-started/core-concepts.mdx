## Sources & Destinations

### Sources
Sources are the **starting points** of your data and AI journey. AI Squared connects with a wide range of sources to facilitate **data extraction and transformation** across multiple systems.

- **Data Sources**: Data warehouses, databases, and files.
- **AI/ML Sources**: Integrate with AI/ML models such as **AWS SageMaker** to bring AI insights into daily business workflows.



### Destinations
Destinations are where AI insights and processed data are delivered in **real-time**. These could be:
- **CRMs**
- **Support software**
- **Marketing automation platforms**
- **Other databases**



## Models & AI Processing

### Data Models
Define and organize data, simplifying the process of querying various sources.

- **SQL Query**: Define models directly using SQL queries, supporting both **dynamic and static** querying.
- **Table Selector**: A **visual** approach to model building, ideal for straightforward selections.
- **dbt Model**: Advanced **data transformation** using the dbt framework.

### AI Models
AI Models define how **input and output** data interact with an AI/ML source.

#### Parameter Harvesting
Before sending parameters to AI/ML models, business applications may retrieve them from **DOM elements** or **queries**, a process called **Harvesting**. AI Squared offers **no-code preprocessors** to dynamically transform parameters, ensuring **seamless integration** without complex coding.


## Syncs: Customizing Data Flow

### Overview
'Syncs' in AI Squared helps you move data from sources to destinations. They help you in mapping the data from your models to the destination.

There are two types of syncs:
- **Full Refresh Sync**: All data is synced from the source to the destination.
- **Incremental Sync**: Only the new or updated data is synced.


## Data Apps & Embedding  

### What are Data Apps?  
Data Apps enable you to bring **AI/ML insights** directly into business applications by connecting to AI/ML sources and building **visualizations** that business users can easily consume.

To get started with Data Apps, you first need to **connect to an AI/ML model**. Refer to the [AI/ML Model Integration](#) section to learn more.

### Creating & Embedding Data Apps  

Once the AI model is connected and **input & output variables** are defined, follow these steps:

1. **Select the model**  
2. **Choose a visualization format** (table, bar chart, pie chart)  
3. **Customize branding** to align with your business identity  
4. **Configure feedback capture mechanisms**  
5. **Embed the Data App** using either:
   - An **embeddable code**  
   - A **browser extension**

## Feedback & Reports  

You can configure and capture **end-user feedback** (from business teams) when they access model insights within a business application.

### **Types of End-User Feedback**  

#### **Qualitative Feedback**  
- Captures user observations or experiences using **free-form text input**.  

#### **Quantitative Feedback**  
- **Thumbs up/down**: Users provide a **Yes/No** rating on AI insights.  
- **Scale-based input**: Users rate usefulness on a **configurable scale** (e.g., **1-3, 1-5, 1-7**).  
- **Single/Multi-select options**: Users choose from predefined **custom options**.

## Analyzing Data App Performance  

Once an AI model is integrated into a business application using Data Apps, you can track **active usage and performance** in the **Data Apps Reports** section.

### **Key Metrics Tracked in Reports**  
- **How many employees access AI model results?**  
- **How actively do users engage with a Data App?**  
- **How satisfied are users with the model results?**  
- **What feedback trends can be observed?**  

The **Data Apps Reports** section provides **real-time visibility** into **AI adoption and model effectiveness** across your business workflows.
