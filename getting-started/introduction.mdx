## What is AI Squared?

AI Squared powers your business applications with AI, turns feedback into decisions, and delivers better customer experiences.

## Who is AI Squared for?

AI Squared is for data science teams and AI/Analytics teams at large enterprises who are:

- Unable to scale AI beyond the pilot stage
- Unable to showcase immediate business impact

## How AI Squared Works

### Data & AI Integration

- Connect your data sources and AI sources effortlessly.
- Bring Your Own Model (BYOM) or integrate any LLM (Open AI, Anthropic, Llama) into your workflows.

### Deliver Actionable Insights

- Embed insights directly into your business applications, right when and where theyâ€™re needed by your business users.
- Use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide contextual data to existing LLMs and deliver relevant insights to users.

### Leverage Business Context

- Capture key business information from tools like CRMs, ERPs, and other business applications to ensure AI models respond to the right context and deliver the right insights.

### Enable Feedback Mechanisms

- Collect user feedback using formats like Thumb Up/Down, Star Ratings, and more and analyze it to improve model performance.
- Gain insights into model effectiveness, user engagement, and areas for improvement by assessing feedback reports.

### Optimize for Maximum Impact

- Evaluate model performance and use data-driven decisions to make informed decisions.
- Continuously iterate use-cases and AI experiments that your teams rely on by using feedback, data, and reporting.
