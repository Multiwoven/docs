---

Below steps will guide you through deploying Multiwoven on a server using Docker Compose. We require PostgreSQL database to store meta data for Multiwoven. We will use Docker Compose to deploy Multiwoven and PostgreSQL.

<Tip>Note: If you are setting up Multiwoven on your local machine, you can skip this section and refer to [Local Setup](/guides/setup/docker-compose-dev) section.</Tip>

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

<Info> All our Docker images are available in x86_64 architecture, make sure your server supports x86_64 architecture.</Info>

## Deployment options

Multiwoven can be deployed using two different options for PostgreSQL database.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="In-built PostgreSQL">

  1. Create a new directory for Multiwoven and navigate to it.

    ```bash
    mkdir multiwoven
    cd multiwoven
    ```
    2. Download the production `docker-compose.yaml` file from the following link.
    
    ```bash
    curl -LO https://aiseepublicstorage.blob.core.windows.net/mw-public-main/docker-compose.yaml && echo "Downloaded docker-compose.yaml successfully" || echo "Failed to download docker-compose.yaml"
    ```

    3. Download the `.env.example` file from the following link.
    
    ```bash
    curl -LO https://aiseepublicstorage.blob.core.windows.net/mw-public-main/.env.example && echo "Downloaded .env.example successfully" || echo "Failed to download .env.example"
    ```

    4. Rename the file .env.example to .env and update the environment variables if required.
    
    ```bash
    mv .env.example .env
    ```
    
    5. Start the Multiwoven using the following command.
    
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    6. Stopping Multiwoven

    To stop the Multiwoven, use the following command.

    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

    7. Upgrading Multiwoven

    When a new version of Multiwoven is released, you can upgrade the Multiwoven using the following command.

    ```bash
    docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d
    ```
    <Tip> Make sure to run the above command from the same directory where the `docker-compose.yaml` file is present.</Tip>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Cloud PostgreSQL">
    
    1. Create a new directory for Multiwoven and navigate to it.
    
        ```bash
        mkdir multiwoven
        cd multiwoven
        ```
        2. Download the production `docker-compose.yaml` file from the following link.
        
        ```bash
        curl -LO https://aiseepublicstorage.blob.core.windows.net/mw-public-main/docker-compose.yaml && echo "Downloaded docker-compose.yaml successfully" || echo "Failed to download docker-compose.yaml"
        ```
        3. Rename the file .env.example to .env and update the **PostgreSQL** environment variables.

        ```DB_HOST``` - Database Host

        ```DB_USERNAME``` - Database Username

        ```DB_PASSWORD``` - Database Password

        The default port for PostgreSQL is 5432. If you are using a different port, update the ```DB_PORT``` environment variable.
        
        ```bash
        mv .env.example .env
        ```
        
        4. Start the Multiwoven using the following command.
        
        ```bash
        docker-compose up -d
        ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Accessing Multiwoven

Once the Multiwoven is up and running, you can access it using the following URL and port.

Multiwoven Server URL:

```http
http://<server-ip>:3000
```

Multiwoven UI Service:

```http
http://<server-ip>:8000
```

<Info>If you are using a custom domain you can update the `API_HOST` and `UI_HOST` environment variable in the `.env` file.</Info>

### Important considerations

- Make sure to update the environment variables in the `.env` file before starting the Multiwoven.

- Make sure to take regular **backups** of the PostgreSQL database.

To restore the backup, you can use the following command.

```bash
cat dump.sql | docker exec -i --user postgres <postgres-container-name> psql -U postgres
```

- If you are using a custom domain, make sure to update the `API_HOST` and `UI_HOST` environment variables in the `.env` file.
