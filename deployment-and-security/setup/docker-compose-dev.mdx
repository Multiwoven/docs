<Warning>**WARNING** The following guide is intended for developers to set-up Multiwoven locally. If you are a user, please refer to the [Self-Hosted](/guides/setup/docker-compose) guide.</Warning>

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

<Tip>**Note**: if you are using Mac or Windows, you will need to install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) instead of just docker. Docker Desktop includes both docker and docker-compose.</Tip>

Verify that you have the correct versions installed:

```bash
docker --version
docker-compose --version
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Multiwoven/multiwoven.git
```

2. Navigate to the `multiwoven` directory

```bash
cd multiwoven
```

3. Initialize .env file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

<Tip>**Note**: Refer to the [Environment Variables](/guides/setup/environment-variables) section for details on the ENV variables used in the Docker environment.</Tip>

4. Build docker images
    
```bash
docker-compose build
```

<Tip>Note: The default build architecture is for **x86_64**. If you are using **arm64** architecture, you will need to run the below command to build the images for arm64.</Tip>

```bash
TARGETARCH=arm64 docker-compose
```

5. Start the containers

```bash
docker-compose up
```

6. Stop the containers

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Usage

Once the containers are running, you can access the ```Multiwoven UI``` at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

The ```multiwoven API``` is available at [http://localhost:3000/api/v1](http://localhost:3000/api/v1).

## Running Tests

1. Running the complete test suite on the multiwoven server

```bash
docker-compose exec multiwoven-server bundle exec rspec
```

## Troubleshooting

To cleanup all images and containers, run the following commands:

```bash
docker rmi -f $(docker images -q)
docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q)
```

prune all unused images, containers, networks and volumes

<Warning>**Danger:** This will remove all unused images, containers, networks and volumes.</Warning>

```bash
docker system prune -a
```
