At AI Squared, we are dedicated to safeguarding your data and privacy. We adhere to industry best practices to ensure the security and protection of your information.

We are SOC 2 Type II certified, demonstrating that we meet stringent standards for information security. This certification confirms that we have implemented robust policies and procedures to ensure the security, availability, processing integrity, and confidentiality of user data. You can trust that your data is safeguarded by the highest levels of security.

## Data Security
We encrypt data at rest and in transit for all our customers. Using Azure's Key Vault, we securely manage encryption keys in accordance with industry best practices. Additionally, customer data is securely isolated from that of other customers, ensuring that your information remains protected and segregated at all times.

## Infrastructure Security
We use Azure AKS to host our application, ensuring robust security through tools like Azure Key Vault, Azure Defender, and Azure Policy. We implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict access to customer data, ensuring that only authorized personnel have access. Your information is safeguarded by stringent security protocols, including limited access to our staff, and is protected by industry-leading infrastructure security measures.
