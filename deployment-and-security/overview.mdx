## Deployment Options

AI Squared offers three main deployment models to support different enterprise needs:

- **Cloud (Managed by AI Squared)**  
  Fully managed SaaS experience hosted by AI Squared. Ideal for teams looking for fast setup and scalability without infrastructure overhead.

- **Deploy Locally**  
  Install and run AI Squared locally on your enterprise infrastructure. This allows tighter control while leveraging the full platform capabilities.

- **Self-Hosted (On-Premise)**  
  For highly regulated environments, AI Squared can be deployed entirely within your own data center or private cloud with no external dependencies.
