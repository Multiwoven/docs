## üöÄ **New Features**


### üîÑ **Enable/Disable Sync**
We‚Äôve introduced the ability to enable or disable a sync. When a sync is disabled, it won‚Äôt execute according to its schedule, allowing you to effectively pause it without the need to delete it. This feature provides greater control and flexibility in managing your sync operations.

### üß† **Source: Databricks AI Model Connector**
Multiwoven now integrates seamlessly with [Databricks AI models](https://docs.squared.ai/guides/data-integration/sources/databricks-model) in the source connectors. This connection allows users to activate AI models directly through Multiwoven, enhancing your data processing and analytical capabilities with cutting-edge AI tools.

### üìä **Destination: Microsoft Excel**
You can now use [Microsoft Excel](https://docs.squared.ai/guides/data-integration/destinations/productivity-tools/microsoft-excel) as a destination connector. Deliver your modeled data directly to Excel sheets for in-depth analysis or reporting. This addition simplifies workflows for those who rely on Excel for their data presentation and analysis needs.

### ‚úÖ **Triggering Test Sync**
Before running a full sync, users can now initiate a test sync to verify that everything is functioning as expected. This feature ensures that potential issues are caught early, saving time and resources.

### üè∑Ô∏è **Sync Run Type**
Sync types are now clearly labeled as either "General" or "Test" in the Syncs Tab. This enhancement provides clearer context for each sync operation, making it easier to distinguish between different sync runs.

### üõ¢Ô∏è **Oracle DB as a Destination Connector**
[Oracle DB](https://docs.squared.ai/guides/data-integration/destinations/database/oracle) is now available as a destination connector. Users can navigate to **Add Destination**, select **Oracle**, and input the necessary database details to route data directly to Oracle databases.

### üóÑÔ∏è **Oracle DB as a Source Connector**
[Oracle DB](https://docs.squared.ai/guides/data-integration/sources/oracle) has also been added as a source connector. Users can pull data from Oracle databases by navigating to **Add Source**, selecting **Oracle**, and entering the database details.
