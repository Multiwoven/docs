# AI Modeling

AI Modeling in AI Squared allows you to connect, configure, and prepare your hosted AI/ML models for use inside business applications. This process ensures that AI outputs are both reliable and context-aware—ready for consumption by business users within CRMs, ERPs, and custom interfaces.

## Why AI Modeling Matters

Simply connecting a model isn't enough—each model expects specific inputs and returns outputs in a particular format. AI Modeling provides a no-code interface to:

- Define input and output schemas
- Format and validate requests before they're sent
- Clean and transform responses before embedding
- Map model insights directly into business apps

## Key Benefits

- **Standardization**: Ensure data passed to and from models adheres to consistent formats.
- **Configurability**: Customize model payloads, headers, and transformations without writing code.
- **Reusability**: Use one model across multiple Data Apps with different UI contexts.
- **Feedback-Ready**: Configure outputs to support user feedback mechanisms like thumbs-up/down, scale ratings, and more.

## What You Can Do in This Section

- Connect to an AI/ML model source (like OpenAI, SageMaker, or Vertex AI)
- Define input and output fields
- Add optional pre-processing and post-processing logic
- Test your model’s behavior with sample payloads
- Finalize your model for embedding into business workflows

AI Modeling is the foundation for building **Data Apps**—which surface model results in enterprise applications and enable user feedback.
