AI Activation in AI Squared refers to the process of operationalizing your AI modelsâ€”bringing model outputs directly into business tools where decisions are made.

This capability allows teams to go beyond experimentation and deploy context-aware AI insights across real business workflows, such as CRMs, service platforms, or internal tools.

## What AI Activation Enables

With AI Activation, you can:

- **Connect any AI model** from cloud providers (e.g., SageMaker, Vertex, OpenAI) or your own endpoints
- **Define input & output schemas** to standardize how models consume and return data
- **Visualize model results** using low-code Data Apps
- **Embed insights directly** inside enterprise applications like Salesforce, ServiceNow, or custom web apps
- **Capture user feedback** to evaluate relevance and improve model performance over time

## Core Concepts

| Concept        | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **AI Modeling** | Configure how input is passed to the model and how output is interpreted. |
| **Data Apps** | Visual components used to surface model predictions directly within business tools. |
| **Feedback** | Capture user responses (e.g., thumbs up/down, star ratings) to monitor model quality and iterate faster. |

## What's Next

Start by configuring your [AI Model](./ai-modeling), then move on to building and embedding [Data Apps](./data-apps) into your business environment.
