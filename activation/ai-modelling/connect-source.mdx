title: Connect Source
description: Learn how to connect and configure an AI/ML model as a source for use within the AI Squared platform.
---

Connecting an AI/ML source is the first step in activating AI within your business workflows. AI Squared allows you to seamlessly integrate your deployed model endpoints‚Äîfrom providers like SageMaker, Vertex AI, Databricks, or custom HTTP APIs.

This guide walks you through connecting a new model source.

---

## Step 1: Select an AI/ML Source

1. Navigate to **AI Activation ‚Üí AI Modeling ‚Üí Connect Source**
2. Click on **Add Source**
3. Choose your desired connector from the list:
   - AWS SageMaker
   - Google Vertex AI
   - Databricks Model
   - OpenAI Model Endpoint
   - HTTP Model Source (Generic)

## Step 2: Enter Endpoint Details

Each connector requires some basic configuration for successful integration.

### Required Fields

- **Endpoint Name** ‚Äì A meaningful name for this model source
- **Endpoint URL** ‚Äì The endpoint where the model is hosted
- **Authentication Method** ‚Äì e.g., OAuth, API Key, Bearer Token
- **Auth Header / Secret Key** ‚Äì If applicable
- **Request Format** ‚Äì Structure expected by the model (e.g., JSON payload)
- **Response Format** ‚Äì Format returned by the model (e.g., structured JSON with keys)

## Step 3: Test Connection

Click **Test Connection** to validate that the model endpoint is reachable and returns a valid response.

- Ensure all fields are correct
- The system will validate the endpoint and return a success or error message

## Step 4: Define Input Schema

The input schema specifies the fields your model expects during inference.

| Field       | Description                                     |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Name**    | Key name expected by the model                  |
| **Type**    | Data type: String, Integer, Float, Boolean      |
| **Value**   | Static or dynamic input value                   |

## Step 5: Define Output Schema

The output schema ensures consistent mapping of the model‚Äôs response.

| Field       | Description                                   |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Field Name** | Key name from the model response            |
| **Type**       | Data type: String, Integer, Float, Boolean |

## Step 6: Save the Source

Click **Save** once configuration is complete. Your model source will now appear in the **AI Modeling** tab and can be used in downstream workflows such as Data Apps or visualizations.
