### What are Models? 

Models allow you to define and organize the data or AI model results you want to query from a source. 

### Creating a Data Model 

Use this section: https://docs.squared.ai/guides/data-activation/models/overview	 

### Creating an AI/ML Model // Harvesting  

Harvesting retrieves input parameters from business tools, essential for real-time machine learning model execution. Currently, we support harvesting input variables from sources such as CRM systems (e.g., Salesforce, Dynamics 365) and custom web applications. 

#### Harvesting Methods 

DOM (Document Object Model) Element Extraction: Harvest data from specific web page elements. 

Query Parameter Extraction: Extract data from URL query parameters. 

  

#### Data Types Supported 

Text: Such as Customer names, product descriptions, etc. 

Images: Used for image recognition. 

Dynamic Variables: Values that change with user interactions. 

 

### Why do you need harvesting?  

Harvesting enables users to send dynamic inputs to a model while generating inference. This helps in personalizing model results and ensures that the insights delivered are relevant. Example: Showcasing predicted AI risk scores specific to the chosen account within Salesforce CRM. In this case, account ID could be used as a harvested parameter depending on the model.  

 

### How can you get started?  

Once you have connected to a model endpoint using one of the connectors, you can 

Navigate to Models section and click on “Add a model”  

Select the harvesting method

1. DOM element: Allows users to harvest data directly from specific DOM elements on web pages where the insights would be embedded.  Users need to specify the selector & value as part of the configuration. The selector will determine which DOM element the data is to be harvested from. The value will allow users to map the harvested data from the DOM element to the input variable required for the model 

2. Query parameter: Allows users to harvest data from URL query parameters. Users need to specify the variable name & value. The variable name will determine the identify the key for the URL param. The value will allow users to map the harvested data from the URL param to the input variable required for the model   

3. Pre- processing:  The pre-processing configuration enables users to process the harvested data before it is sent to the model as input. The required processing can be specified using liquid templating (link to liquid templating: https://shopify.github.io/liquid/). The main purpose of pre-processing usually is to either transform or convert the harvested parameters into the format expected by the model.
