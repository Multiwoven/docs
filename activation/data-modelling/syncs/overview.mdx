### Introduction

Syncs help in determining how the data appears in your destination. They are used to map the data from the source to the destination.

In order to create a sync, you need to have a source and a destination. The source is the data that you want to sync and the destination is where you want to sync the data to.

### Types of Syncs

There are two types of syncs:

1. **Full Refresh Syncs**: This sync type replaces all the data in the destination with the data from the source. This is useful when you want to replace all the data in the destination with the data from the source.

2. **Incremental Syncs**: This sync type only syncs the data that has changed since the last sync. This is useful when you want to sync only the data that has changed since the last sync.

### Important Concepts

1. **Streams**: Streams in AI Squared are referred to the destination APIs that you want to sync the data to. For example, If you want to Sync the data to Salesforce, then `Account`, `Contact`, `Opportunity` are the streams.
