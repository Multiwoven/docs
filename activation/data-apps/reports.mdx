## Using Reports to Improve AI Performance

- **Low positive feedback?** → Revisit model logic, prompt formatting, or context.
- **Low engagement?** → Ensure placement within the business app is visible and accessible.
- **Inconsistent feedback?** → Collect additional context using text or multi-select feedback options.
