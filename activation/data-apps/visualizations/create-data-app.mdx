---

A **Data App** allows you to visualize and embed AI model predictions into business applications. This guide walks through the setup steps to publish your first Data App using a connected AI/ML model.

---

## Step 1: Select a Model

1. Navigate to **Data Apps** from the sidebar.
2. Click **Create New Data App**.
3. Select the AI model you want to connect from the dropdown list.
   - Only models with input and output schemas defined will appear here.

## Step 2: Choose Display Type

Choose how the AI output will be displayed:
- **Table**: For listing multiple rows of output
- **Bar Chart** / **Pie Chart**: For aggregate or category-based insights
- **Text Card**: For single prediction or summary output

Each display type supports basic customization (e.g., column order, labels, units).

## Step 3: Customize Appearance

You can optionally style the Data App to match your brand:
- Modify font styles, background colors, and borders
- Add custom labels or tooltips
- Choose dark/light mode compatibility

> ðŸ“Œ Custom CSS is not supported; visual changes are made through the built-in configuration options.

## Step 4: Configure Feedback (Optional)

Enable in-app feedback collection for business users interacting with the app:
- **Thumbs Up / Down**
- **Rating Scale (1â€“5, configurable)**
- **Text Comments**
- **Predefined Options (Multi-select)**

Feedback will be collected and visible under **Reports > Data Apps Reports**.

## Step 5: Save & Preview

1. Click **Save** to create the Data App.
2. Use the **Preview** mode to validate how the results and layout look.
3. If needed, go back to edit layout or display type.
