The **Platform Extension** is a no-code method to bring AI-powered **Data Apps** into your everyday business tools (like Salesforce, HubSpot, or internal apps) using the AI Squared Chrome Extension.

It allows business users to “pin” a Data App to specific screens without modifying the host application, perfect for surfacing insights exactly where decisions are made.


## Choose Integration Method

When creating or configuring a Data App, select your rendering method:

- **Embeddable Code**: Iframe-based embedding

- ✅ **No-Code Integration**: Uses the AI Squared Chrome Extension (Platform Extension)

## Pin a Data App to a Page

You can pin a Data App to automatically render when a certain app or page loads.

- Click **Run** next to a Data App
- The extension remembers this page and keeps the app live until unpinned
- AI output is displayed in a floating panel on the right

## Best Practices

- Use clear Data App names (e.g. “Lead Scoring” or “Support Next Action”)
- Pin insights where reps, agents, or analysts spend time
- Combine with **Feedback Capture** to evaluate performance
