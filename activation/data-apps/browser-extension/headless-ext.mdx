The **Headless Extension** is a lightweight Chrome extension package that allows advanced users to run AI models directly on webpages without embedding anything in the page itself. This is ideal for internal use cases where you want automation, harvesting, or insight overlay without platform and closed environments.

This guide walks through the steps to enable, install, and run `.air` model files via the headless mode.


## Enable the Headless Extension

1. Go to **Settings > Organization > Headless** tab.
