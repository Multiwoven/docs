# What Are Data Apps?

**Data Apps** in AI Squared are lightweight, embeddable interfaces that bring AI/ML outputs directly to the point of business decision-making. These apps allow business users to interact with AI model outputs in contextâ€”within CRMs, support tools, or web appsâ€”without needing to switch platforms or understand the underlying AI infrastructure.

Data Apps bridge the last mile between ML models and real business outcomes.
