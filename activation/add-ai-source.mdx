You can connect your hosted AI/ML model endpoints to AI Squared in just a few steps. This allows your models to power real-time insights across business applications.

---

## Step 1: Select Your AI/ML Source

1. Navigate to **Sources** → **AI/ML Sources** in the sidebar.
2. Click **“Add Source”**.
3. Select the AI/ML source connector from the list.

## Step 2: Define and Connect the Endpoint

Fill in the required connection details:

- **Endpoint Name** – A descriptive name for easy identification.
- **Endpoint URL** – The hosted URL of your AI/ML model.
- **Authentication Method** – Choose between `OAuth`, `API Key`, etc.
- **Authorization Header** – Format of the header (if applicable).
- **Secret Key** – For secure access.
- **Request Format** – Define the input structure (e.g., JSON).
- **Response Format** – Define how the model returns predictions.

## Step 3: Test the Source

Before saving, click **“Test Connection”** to verify that the endpoint is reachable and properly configured.

> ⚠️ If the test fails, check for errors in the endpoint URL, headers, or authentication values.

## Step 4: Save the Source

Once the test passes:

- Provide a name and optional description.
- Click **“Save”** to finalize setup.
- Your model source will now appear under **AI/ML Sources**.

## Step 5: Define Input Schema

The **Input Schema** tells AI Squared how to format data before sending it to the model.

Each input field requires:
- **Name** – Matches the key in your model’s input payload.
- **Type** – `String`, `Integer`, `Float`, or `Boolean`.
- **Value Type** – `Dynamic` (from data/apps) or `Static` (fixed value).

## Step 6: Define Output Schema

The **Output Schema** tells AI Squared how to interpret the model's response.

Each output field requires:
- **Field Name** – The key returned by the model.
- **Type** – Define the type: `String`, `Integer`, `Float`, `Boolean`.

This ensures downstream systems or visualizations can consume the output consistently.

## ✅ You’re Done!

You’ve successfully added and configured your hosted AI/ML model as a source in AI Squared. Your model can now be used in **Data Apps**, **Chatbots**, and other workflow automations.
