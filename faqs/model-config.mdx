This section answers frequently asked questions about configuring AI models within AI Squared—including how to define schemas, preprocess inputs, and ensure model compatibility.

## Input & Output Schema

### What is the input schema used for?

The input schema defines the structure of data sent to your model. Each key in the schema maps to a variable used by the model endpoint.

- Ensure all required fields are covered
- Match data types (string, integer, float, boolean) exactly
- Use dynamic/static value tagging depending on your use case

### What is the output schema used for?

The output schema maps the model’s prediction response to fields that can be used in visualizations and downstream applications.

- Identify key-value pairs in the model response
- Use flat structures (nested objects not supported currently)
- Label predictions clearly for user-facing display

## Preprocessing & Formatting

### How do I clean or transform inputs before sending them to the model?

Use AI Squared's built-in **Preprocessing Rules**, which allow no-code logic to:

- Format strings or numbers (e.g., round decimals)
- Apply conditional logic (e.g., replace nulls)
- Normalize or scale inputs

Preprocessors are configurable per input field.

## Updating a Model Source

### Can I update a connected model after initial setup?

Yes, you can:

- Edit endpoint details (URL, auth, headers)
- Modify input/output schemas
- Add or update preprocessing rules

Changes will reflect in associated Data Apps using the model.

## Debugging Model Issues

### How can I test if my model responds correctly?

1. Navigate to the AI Modeling section and click on **Test Model**
2. Provide sample input data based on your schema
3. Review the response payload

Common issues include:

- Auth failures (invalid API keys or tokens)
- Incorrect input field names or types
- Mismatched response format from expected schema
