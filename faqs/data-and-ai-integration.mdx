This section addresses frequently asked questions when connecting data sources, setting up AI/ML model endpoints, or troubleshooting integration issues within AI Squared.

---

## Data Source Integration

### Why is my data source connection failing?

- Verify that the connection credentials (e.g., host, port, username, password) are correct.
- Ensure that the network/firewall rules allow connections to AI Squared’s IPs (for on-prem data).
- Check if the database is online and reachable.

### What formats are supported for ingesting data?

- AI Squared supports connections to major databases like Snowflake, BigQuery, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and more.
- Files such as CSV, Excel, and JSON can be ingested via SFTP or cloud storage (e.g., S3).

## AI/ML Model Integration

### How do I connect my hosted model?

- Use the [Add AI/ML Source](/activation/ai-modelling/connect-source) guide to define your model endpoint.
- Provide input/output schema details so the platform can handle data mapping effectively.

### What types of model endpoints are supported?

- REST-based hosted models with JSON payloads
- Hosted services like AWS SageMaker, Vertex AI, and custom HTTP endpoints

## Sync & Schema Issues

### Why is my sync failing?

- Confirm that your data model and sync mapping are valid
- Check that input types in your model schema match your data source fields
- Review logs for any missing fields or payload mismatches

### How can I test if my connection is working?

- Use the “Test Connection” button when setting up a new source or sync.
- If testing fails, examine error messages and retry with updated configs.
