<Warning>
Google Sheets is equipped with specific data capacity constraints, which, when exceeded, can lead to synchronization issues. Here's a concise overview of these limitations:

- **Cell Limit**: A Google Sheets document is capped at `10 million` cells, which can be spread across one or multiple sheets. Once this limit is reached, no additional data can be added, either in the form of new rows or columns.
- **Character Limit per Cell**: Each cell in Google Sheets can contain up to `50,000` characters. It's crucial to consider this when syncing data that includes fields with lengthy text.
- **Column Limit**: A single worksheet within Google Sheets is limited to `18,278` columns.
- **Worksheet Limit**: There is a cap of `200` worksheets within a single Google Sheets spreadsheet.

Given these restrictions, Google Sheets is recommended primarily for smaller, non-critical data engagements.
It may not be the optimal choice for handling expansive data operations due to its potential for sync failures upon reaching these imposed limits.
