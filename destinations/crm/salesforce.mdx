## Salesforce Connector Configuration and Credential Retrieval Guide

### Prerequisite Requirements

Before initiating the Salesforce connector setup, ensure you have an appropriate Salesforce edition. This setup requires either the Enterprise edition of Salesforce, the Professional Edition with an API access add-on, or the Developer edition. For further information on API access within Salesforce, please consult the [Salesforce documentation](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/).

<Tip>
  If you need a Developer edition of Salesforce, you can register at [Salesforce
  Developer Signup](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup).

    For Multiwoven Open Source, certain OAuth credentials are necessary for authentication. These credentials include:

    - Access Token
    - Refresh Token
    - Instance URL
    - Client ID
    - Client Secret

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Login">
        Start by logging into your Salesforce account with admin rights. Look for a Setup option in the menu at the top-right corner of the screen and click on it.

      <Step title="New Connected App">
        Find a button that says New Connected App at the top right and click it.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Fill the details">
        You'll be taken to a page to set up your new app.
        Here, you need to fill in some basic info: the name you want for your app, its API name (a technical identifier), and your email address.

      </Step>
      <Step title="Enable OAuth Settings">
        Now, look for a section named API (Enable OAuth Settings) and check the box for Enable OAuth Settings.
        There’s a box for a Callback URL; type in https://login.salesforce.com/ there.
        You also need to pick some permissions from a list called Selected OAuth Scopes. Choose these: Access and manage your data (api), Perform requests on your behalf at any time (refresh_token, offline_access), Provide access to your data via the Web (web), and then add them to your app settings.

      </Step>
      <Step title="OAuth policies">
        On the next screen, click Edit.
        There’s an option for OAuth policies; under Permitted Users, choose All users may self-authorize. Save your changes.

      </Step>
      <Step title="Save Permissions">
        Once more, go to the API (Enable OAuth Settings) section. Click on Manage Consumer Details.
        You need to write down two things: the Consumer Key and Consumer Secret.
        These are important because you'll use them to connect Salesforce.

      <Steps>
        <Step title="Getting the Code">
          First, open Salesforce in your preferred web browser. 
          To get the code, open a new tab and type in a special web address (URL). 
          You'll need to change **CONSUMER_KEY** to the Consumer Key you noted earlier. 
          Also, replace **INSTANCE_URL** with your specific Salesforce instance name (for example, ours is multiwoven-dev in https://multiwoven-dev.develop.lightning.force.com/).

          ```
            https://INSTANCE_URL.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=CONSUMER_KEY&redirect_uri=https://login.salesforce.com/
          ```

          If you see any alerts asking for permission, go ahead and allow them.
          After that, the browser will take you to a new webpage.
          Pay attention to this new web address because it contains the code you need.
          Save the code available in the new URL as shown in the below example.

          ```
            https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/success?code=aPrx0jWjRo8KRXs42SX1Q7A5ckVpD9lSAvxdKnJUApCpikQQZf.YFm4bHNDUlgiG_PHwWQ%3D%3Dclient_id = "3MVG9pRzvMkjMb6kugcl2xWhaCVwiZPwg17wZSM42kf6HqY4jmw6ocKKoYYLz4ztHqM1vWxMbZB6sxQQU"
          ```
        </Step>
      <Step title="Getting the Access Token and Refresh Token">
        Now, you'll use a tool called curl to ask for more keys, known as tokens.
        You'll type a command into your computer that includes the special code you just got.
        Remember to replace **CODE** with your code, and also replace **CONSUMER_KEY** and **CONSUMER_SECRET** with the details you saved from when you set up the app in Salesforce.

        ```
        curl -X POST https://INSTANCE_URL.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token?code=CODE&grant_type=authorization_code&client_id=CONSUMER_KEY&client_secret=CONSUMER_SECRET&redirect_uri=https://login.salesforce.com/
        ```
        After you send this command, you'll get back a response that includes your access_token and refresh_token.
        These tokens are what you'll use to securely access Salesforce data.

        ```
          {
            "access_token": "access_token",
            "refresh_token": "refresh_token",
            "signature": "signature",
            "scope": "scopes",
            "id_token": "id_token",
            "instance_url": "https://multiwoven-dev.develop.my.salesforce.com",
            "id": "id",
            "token_type": "Bearer",
            "issued_at": "1707415379555",
            "api_instance_url": "https://api.salesforce.com"
        }
        ```
        This way, you’re essentially getting the necessary permissions and access to work with Salesforce data in more detail.
