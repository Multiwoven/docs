Welcome to the MultiWoven API documentation! You can use our API to access all the features of the MultiWoven platform. 

## Authentication

The MultiWoven API uses a JWT-based authentication mechanism. To access the API, you need a valid JWT token which should be included in the header of your requests. This ensures that your interactions with the API are secure and authenticated.

```text
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_JWT_TOKEN>'
```

<Warning>It is advised to keep your JWT token safe and not share it with anyone. If you think your token has been compromised, you can generate a new token from the MultiWoven dashboard.</Warning>

## API Endpoints

The MultiWoven API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts JSON-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

### Base URL

The base URL for all API requests is `https://api.multiwoven.com/v1/`.

### API Reference

## Pagination

Requests that return multiple items will be paginated to 100 items by default. You can specify further pages with the `page` parameter. You can also set a custom page size up to 100 with the `page_size` parameter.

```text
https://api.multiwoven.com/v1/models?page=2&page_size=50
```

## Rate Limiting

The MultiWoven API is rate limited to 100 requests per minute. If you exceed this limit, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

## Errors

The MultiWoven API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general, codes in the `2xx` range indicate success, codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided, and codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with MultiWoven's servers.
