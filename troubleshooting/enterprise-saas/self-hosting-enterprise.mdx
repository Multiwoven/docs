Our self-hosted Enterprise SaaS offers 1 click deployment on your infrastructure. You can deploy and setup the platform on your private VPC across multiple cloud providers.

The self-hosted Enterprise SaaS is container based and can be deployed on any Docker compatible infrastructure. 

## Docker Compose

To begin with, you can deploy the platform using Docker Compose using a simple virtual machine like EC2 or GCP VM. 

For more information on deploying the enterprise platform using Docker Compose, refer to the [**Docker Compose guide**](https://docs.squared.ai/open-source/guides/setup/docker-compose) in the open-source documentation. The Docker Compose guide provides detailed instructions on setting up the platform using Docker Compose.

The difference between the open-source platform and the enterprise platform deployment is the docker image used for the platform.

<Tip>The enterprise platform uses the `squaredai/enterprise` docker image, which extends the platform with additional enterprise features.</Tip>

## Kubernetes

For a more scalable and production-grade deployment, you can deploy the platform on Kubernetes. The platform provides a [Helm chart](https://docs.squared.ai/open-source/guides/setup/helm) for deploying the platform on Kubernetes.

You can refer to the [Environment Variables](https://docs.squared.ai/open-source/guides/setup/helm#environment-variables) section to configure the platform for your environment.

<Info>You can also refer to the [Production Deployment](https://docs.squared.ai/open-source/guides/setup/docker-compose) section for a more detailed guide on deploying the platform to other cloud providers like AWS, GCP, and Azure.</Info>

## Accessing the Platform

Once you have deployed the platform, you can access the platform by visiting `localhost:8000` to access the platform UI. You can sign up for a new account and log in to the platform, you should be able to see the platform dashboard.
