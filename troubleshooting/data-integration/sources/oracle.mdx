## Connect AI Squared to Oracle

This guide will help you configure the Oracle Connector in AI Squared to access and transfer data to your Oracle database.

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the necessary host, port, SID or service name, username, and password from your Oracle database.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Connect to Oracle database

### Step 1: Locate Oracle database Configuration Details

In your Oracle database, you'll need to find the necessary configuration details:

1. **Host and Port:**
   - For local servers, the host is typically `localhost` and the default port is `1521`.
   - For remote servers, check your server settings or consult with your database administrator to get the correct host and port.
   - Note down the host and port as they will be used to connect to your Oracle database.

2. **SID or Service Name:**
   - To find your SID or Service name:
        1. **Using SQL*Plus or SQL Developer:**
           - Connect to your Oracle database using SQL*Plus or SQL Developer.
           - Execute the following query:
             ```sql
             select instance from v$thread
             ```
             or
             ```sql
             SELECT sys_context('userenv', 'service_name') AS service_name FROM dual;
             ```
           - The result will display the SID or service name of your Oracle database.
        2. **Checking the TNSNAMES.ORA File:**
           - Locate and open the `tnsnames.ora` file on your system. This file is usually found in the `ORACLE_HOME/network/admin` directory.
           - Look for the entry corresponding to your database connection. The `SERVICE_NAME` or `SID` will be listed within this entry.
      - Note down the SID or service name as it will be used to connect to your Oracle database.

3. **Username and Password:**
   - In the Oracle, you can find or create a user with the necessary permissions to access the database.
   - Note down the username and password as it will be used to connect to your Oracle database.

### Step 2: Configure Oracle Connector in Your Application

Now that you have gathered all the necessary details, enter the following information in your application:

- **Host:** The host of your Oracle database.
- **Port:** The port number of your Oracle database.
- **SID:** The SID or service name you want to connect to.
- **Username:** Your Oracle username.
- **Password:** The corresponding password for the username.


### Step 3: Test the Oracle Database Connection

After configuring the connector in your application:

1. Save the configuration settings.
2. Test the connection to Oracle database from your application to ensure everything is set up correctly.
3. Run a test query or check the connection status to verify successful connectivity.

Your Oracle connector is now configured and ready to query data from your Oracle database.
