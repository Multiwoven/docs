### What if I Alter My Model?
Changes in your model configuration impact the sync process, particularly for SaaS destinations. Only the mapped columns in your sync configurations are tracked for changes.

### What Happens When I Delete a Model?
If you delete a model, all syncs associated with it are also deleted. However, the source and destination configurations remain intact.

### Can I Sync Data from Multiple Sources to a Single Destination?
Yes, you can sync data from multiple sources to a single destination. You can create multiple syncs for each source and map them to the same destination.
