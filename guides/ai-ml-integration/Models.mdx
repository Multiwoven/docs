  The AI/ML Model creation process involves defining how to harvest the necessary values for the input variables that were specified during the creation of an AI/ML Source Connector. This step is crucial for ensuring that the data from your source is properly mapped to the corresponding input variables in your model.

  By accurately defining the data extraction and processing methods, you ensure that the AI/ML model receives the relevant and correctly formatted data needed for making predictions or decisions. This process sets the foundation for the model's overall performance and accuracy.
