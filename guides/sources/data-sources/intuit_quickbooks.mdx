   - Once in Playground follow the steps to retrive your **Client ID, Client Secret, Realm ID, and Refresh Token** and note them down.

## Step 3: Configure Intuit QuickBooks Connector in Your Application

Now that you have gathered all the necessary details, enter the following information in your application:

- **Client ID:** The unique identifier for your QuickBooks application. This is issued by Intuit when you register your app in the QuickBooks Developer Portal.

- **Client Secret:** A secure secret key associated with your Client ID. Used together with the Client ID to authenticate your app when requesting OAuth tokens.

- **Realm ID:** A unique identifier for a QuickBooks company (also known as the Company ID). Required to make API requests specific to that company account.

- **Refresh Token:** A long-lived token used to obtain a new access token when the current one expires. This is essential for maintaining a persistent connection without requiring the user to re-authenticate.

## Step 4: Test the Intuit QuickBooks Connection

After configuring the connector in your application:

1. Save the configuration settings.
2. Test the connection to Intuit QuickBooks database from your application to ensure everything is set up correctly.
3. Run a test query or check the connection status to verify successful connectivity.

Your Intuit QuickBooks connector is now configured and ready to query data from your Intuit QuickBooks database.
