## Connect AI Squared to BigQuery

This guide will help you configure the BigQuery Connector in AI Squared to access and use your BigQuery data.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need to:

1. **Enable BigQuery API and Locate Dataset(s):**

   - Log in to the [Google Developers Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard).
   - If you don't have a project, create one.
   - Enable the [BigQuery API for your project](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=bigquery&_ga=2.71379221.724057513.1673650275-1611021579.1664923822&_gac=1.213641504.1673650813.EAIaIQobChMIt9GagtPF_AIVkgB9Ch331QRREAAYASAAEgJfrfD_BwE).
   - Copy your Project ID.
   - Find the Project ID and Dataset ID of your BigQuery datasets. You can find this by querying the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA` view or by visiting the Google Cloud web console.

2. **Create a Service Account:**

   - Follow the instructions in our [Google Cloud Provider (GCP) documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create) to create a service account.

   - Find your service account and click on edit.
   - Go to the "Assign Roles" tab and click "Add another role".
   - Search and select the "BigQuery User" and "BigQuery Data Viewer" roles.
   - Click "Save".

4. **Download JSON Key File:**

   - In the Google Cloud web console, navigate to the [IAM](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam?supportedpurview=project,folder,organizationId) & Admin section and select IAM.
   - Find your service account and click on it.
   - Go to the "Keys" tab and click "Add Key".
   - Select "Create new key" and choose JSON format.
   - Click "Download".

### Steps


### Authentication

Authentication is supported via the following:

- **Dataset ID and JSON Key File**

  - **[Dataset ID](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/datasets):** The ID of the dataset within Google BigQuery that you want to access. This can be found in Step 1.
  - **[JSON Key File](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete):** The JSON key file containing the authentication credentials for your service account.
