**AI Delivery** is how insights generated from your AI models reach the hands of your business usersâ€”inside the tools they already use, like CRMs, support platforms, and internal dashboards.

This section helps you understand:

- âœ… How **Data Apps** (configured in [AI Activation â†’ Data Apps](/activation/data-apps/overview)) connect to your deployed **AI/ML Sources**
- âœ… How those Data Apps are **delivered** into applications like **Salesforce**, custom web apps, or via our browser extension
- âœ… How AI Delivery fits into the broader **AI Activation** workflow

## How it all connects

Here's the end-to-end journey:

1. **Integrate AI Model**  
   Configure your model endpoint under **AI & Data Integration â†’ AI/ML Sources**

2. **Activate the Model with a Data App**  
   Build a Data App under **AI Activation â†’ Data Apps** using your model

3. **Deliver it where users work**  
   Embed the Data App inside apps like Salesforce, web apps, or internal tools

## Available AI Delivery Methods

AI Squared supports multiple ways to embed Data Apps into your business applications. Each method is designed to meet different platform capabilities and enterprise needs.

1. **Iframe Embedding**

Embed a Data App directly into any internal or external web application using a secure iframe snippet. Ideal for:

- Internal dashboards

- Custom-built apps

- Applications that support iframe widgets

2. **Native App Integrations**

Use native UI components for deeper embedding in specific platforms. Examples include:

- Microsoft Dynamics 365 using Power Component Framework (PCF)

- Salesforce using Visualforce or Lightning components

3. **Browser Extension**

Use the AI Squared browser extension to overlay Data Apps directly within third-party web tools without modifying the underlying application code. Works well for:

- SaaS apps without native integration support

- Internal tools where code access is restricted
