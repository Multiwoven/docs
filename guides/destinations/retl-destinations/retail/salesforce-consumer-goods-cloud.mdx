## Connector Configuration and Credential Retrieval Guide

### Prerequisite Requirements

When setting up an integration between Salesforce Consumer Goods Cloud and Multiwoven, certain credentials are required to authenticate and establish a secure connection. Below is a brief description of each credential needed:

- **Username**: The Salesforce username used to log in.
- **Password**: The password associated with the Salesforce username.
- **Host**: The URL of your Salesforce instance (e.g., https://login.salesforce.com).
- **Security Token**: An additional security key that is appended to your password for API access from untrusted networks.
- **Client ID** and **Client Secret**: These are part of the OAuth credentials required for authenticating an application with Salesforce.
  They are obtained when you set up a new "Connected App" in Salesforce for integrating with external applications. You may refer our [Salesforce CRM docs](https://docs.multiwoven.com/destinations/crm/salesforce#destination-setup) for further details.

      <Step title="Reset My Security Token">
        Click on Reset My Security Token under the Personal section. Salesforce will send the new security token to the email address associated with your account.
        If you do not see the option to reset the security token, it may be because your organization uses Single Sign-On (SSO) or has IP restrictions that negate the need for a token.
