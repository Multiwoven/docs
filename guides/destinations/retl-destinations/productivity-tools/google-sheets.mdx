title: "Google Sheets - Service Account"
description: "Google Sheets serves as an effective reverse ETL destination, enabling real-time data synchronization from data warehouses to a collaborative, user-friendly spreadsheet environment. It democratizes data access, allowing stakeholders to analyze, share, and act on insights without specialized skills. The platform supports automation and customization, enhancing decision-making and operational efficiency. Google Sheets transforms complex data into actionable intelligence, fostering a data-driven culture across organizations."

<Warning>
Google Sheets is equipped with specific data capacity constraints, which, when exceeded, can lead to synchronization issues. Here's a concise overview of these limitations:

- **Cell Limit**: A Google Sheets document is capped at `10 million` cells, which can be spread across one or multiple sheets. Once this limit is reached, no additional data can be added, either in the form of new rows or columns.
- **Character Limit per Cell**: Each cell in Google Sheets can contain up to `50,000` characters. It's crucial to consider this when syncing data that includes fields with lengthy text.
- **Column Limit**: A single worksheet within Google Sheets is limited to `18,278` columns.
- **Worksheet Limit**: There is a cap of `200` worksheets within a single Google Sheets spreadsheet.

Given these restrictions, Google Sheets is recommended primarily for smaller, non-critical data engagements.
It may not be the optimal choice for handling expansive data operations due to its potential for sync failures upon reaching these imposed limits.
