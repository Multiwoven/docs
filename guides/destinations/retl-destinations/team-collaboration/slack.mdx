## Slack Connector Configuration and Credential Retrieval Guide

### Prerequisite Requirements

To access Slack through AI Squared, you must authenticate using an API Token. This authentication can be obtained through a Slack App. However, if you already possess one, it remains valid for use with this integration.
Given that AI Squared operates as a reverse ETL platform, requiring write access to perform its functions, we recommend creating a restricted API key that permits write access specifically for AI Squared's use.
This strategy enables you to maintain control over the extent of actions AI Squared can execute within your Slack environment, ensuring security and compliance with your data governance policies.
