## Setting Up a Model for Mailchimp

To sync data to Mailchimp, you first need to prepare your data by creating a model based on the source data. Here's how:

1. **Review Your Source Data**
    Identify the key fields you need from the source (e.g., email, first name, last name, and tags).

2. **Create the Model**
    Select the necessary fields from your source.
    Map these fields to match Mailchimp’s required parameters, such as `email`, `merge_fields.FNAME` (first name), and `tags.0`.

3. **Save and Validate**
    Ensure the model is structured properly and contains clean, valid data.

4. **Sync the Model**
    Use the model as the basis for setting up your sync to Mailchimp.
    Map fields from the model to the corresponding Mailchimp parameters during sync configuration.

This step ensures your data is well-structured and ready to integrate with Mailchimp seamlessly.
