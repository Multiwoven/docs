## Connect AI Squared to MariaDB

This guide will help you configure the MariaDB Connector in AI Squared to access and transfer data to your MariaDB database.

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the necessary host, port, username, password, and database name from your MariaDB server.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Connect to MariaDB

## Step 1: Navigate to MariaDB Console

Start by logging into your MariaDB Management Console and navigating to the MariaDB service.

1. Sign in to your MariaDB account on your local server or through the MariaDB Enterprise interface.
2. In the MariaDB console, select the service you want to connect to.

## Step 2: Locate MariaDB Configuration Details

Once you're in the MariaDB console, you'll find the necessary configuration details:

1. **Host and Port:**
   - For local servers, the host is typically `localhost` and the default port is `3306`.
   - For remote servers, check your server settings or consult with your database administrator to get the correct host and port.
   - Note down the host and port as they will be used to connect to your MariaDB service.

2. **Username and Password:**
   - In the MariaDB console, you can find or create a user with the necessary permissions to access the database.
   - Note down the username and password as they are required for the connection.

3. **Database Name:**
   - List the available databases using the command `SHOW DATABASES;` in the MariaDB console.
   - Choose the database you want to connect to and note down its name.

## Step 3: Configure MariaDB Connector in Your Application

Now that you have gathered all the necessary details, enter the following information in your application:

- **Host:** The host of your MariaDB service.
- **Port:** The port number of your MariaDB service.
- **Username:** Your MariaDB service username.
- **Password:** The corresponding password for the username.
- **Database:** The name of the database you want to connect to.

## Step 4: Test the MariaDB Connection

After configuring the connector in your application:

1. Save the configuration settings.
2. Test the connection to MariaDB from your application to ensure everything is set up correctly.

By following these steps, youâ€™ve successfully set up an MariaDB destination connector in AI Squared. You can now efficiently transfer data to your MariaDB endpoint for storage or further distribution within AI Squared.
