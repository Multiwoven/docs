## Connecting Your AI & Data 

Connecting your AI and data is the foundational step in bringing AI insights to the business applications where work happens. By seamlessly integrating data sources and AI models, you enable real-time intelligence to flow into your daily workflows, empowering business users with actionable AI insights. AI Squared simplifies this process by providing no-code connectors for AI/ML models and data sources, eliminating the need for complex engineering efforts.

A data source refers to any repository where business information is stored. Common examples include data warehouses such as Snowflake and Google BigQuery, as well as databases, CSV files, SFTP servers.  

An AI source refers to the hosting environment where your AI or machine learning models reside. These environments can include cloud-based platforms such as Amazon SageMaker, Google Cloud's Vertex AI, and Databricks, as well as custom model endpoints tailored to specific organizational needs. 

### Destinations
A destination is any platform, tool, or service where processed data and AI insights are delivered for end-users to access and utilize within their workflows.
