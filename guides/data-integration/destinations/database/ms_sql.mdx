## Setting MS SQL Connector in AI Squared

To integrate Microsoft SQL with AI Squared, you need to establish a destination connector.
This connector will enable AI Squared to load data from various sources efficiently.
Below are the steps to set up the MS SQL Destination connector in AI Squared:

### Step 1: Access AI Squared

- Log in to your AI Squared account.
- Navigate to the `destinations` section where you can manage your destinations.

### Step 2: Create a New destination Connector

- Click on the `Add destination` button.
- Select `Microsoft SQL` from the list of available destination types.

### Step 3: Configure Connection Settings

You'll need to provide the following details to establish a connection between AI Squared and your MicrosoftSQL Database:

`Host` The hostname or IP address of the server where your MicrosoftSQL database is hosted.

`Port` The port number on which your MicrosoftSQL server is listening (default is 1433).

`Database` The name of the database you want to connect to.

`Schema` The schema within your MicrosoftSQL database you wish to access. The default schema for Microsoft SQL Server is dbo. 

`Username` The username used to access the database.

`Password` The password associated with the username.

Enter these details in the respective fields on the connector configuration page and press continue.

### Step 4: Test the Connection

- Once you've entered the necessary information. The next step is automated **Test Connection** feature to ensure that AI Squared can successfully connect to your MicrosoftSQL database.
- If the test is successful, you'll receive a confirmation message. If not, double-check your entered details for any errors.

### Step 5: Finalize the destination Connector Setup

- Save the connector settings to establish the destination connection.

## Notes

- The Azure SQL Database firewall is a security feature that protects customer data by blocking access to the SQL Database server by default. To allow access, users can configure firewall rules to specify which IP addresses are permitted to access the database. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/firewall-configure?view=azuresql

- Your credentials must be able to: Add/update/delete rows in your sync's table.

- Get the connection information you need to connect to the database in Azure SQL Database. You'll need the fully qualified server name or host name, database name, and login information for the connection setup.
  - Sign in to the Azure portal.
  - Navigate to the SQL Databases or SQL Managed Instances page.
  - On the Overview page, review the fully qualified server name next to Server name for the database in Azure SQL Database or the fully qualified server name (or IP address) next to Host for an Azure SQL Managed Instance or SQL Server on Azure VM. To copy the server name or host name, hover over it and select the Copy icon.
