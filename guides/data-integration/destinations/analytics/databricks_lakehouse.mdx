## Connect AI Squared to Databricks

This guide will help you configure the Databricks Connector in AI Squared to access and use your Databricks data.

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the necessary Host URL and API Token from Databricks.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Connect to Databricks

## Step 1: Navigate to Databricks

Start by logging into your Databricks account and navigating to the Databricks workspace.

1. Sign in to your Databricks account at [Databricks Login](https://accounts.cloud.databricks.com/login).
2. Once logged in, you will be directed to the Databricks workspace dashboard.

## Step 2: Locate Databricks Host URL and API Token

Once you're logged into Databricks, you'll find the necessary configuration details:

1. **Host URL:**
   - The Host URL is the first part of the URL when you log into your Databricks. It will look something like `https://<your-instance>.databricks.com`.

2. **API Token:**
   - Click on your user icon in the upper right corner and select "Settings" from the dropdown menu.
   - In the Settings page, navigate to the "Developer" tab.
   - Here, you can create a new Access Token by clicking on Manage then "Generate New Token." Give it a name and set the expiration duration.
   - Once the token is generated, copy it as it will be required for configuring the connector. **Note:** This token will only be shown once, so make sure to store it securely.
