## Connect AI Squared to S3

This page describes how to add AWS S3 as a source.

AI Squared lets you pull data from CSV and Parquet files stored in an Amazon S3 bucket and push them to downstream destinations. To get started, you need an S3 bucket and AWS credentials.

## Connector Configuration and Credentials Guide

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the necessary information based on how you plan to authenticate to AWS. The two types of authentication we support are:
- IAM User with access id and secret access key.
- IAM Role with ARN configured with an external ID so that AI Square can connect to your S3 bucket.

Additional info you will need regardless of authentication type will be:
- Region
- Bucket name
- The type of file we are working with (CSV or Parquet)
- Path to the CSV or Parquet files

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Sign In">
        Log in to your AWS account at [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
      </Step>
      <Step title="Users">
        Navigate to the the **Users**. This can be found in the left navigation under "Access Management" -> "Users".

        </Frame>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Access/Secret Key">
        Once inside the Users page, Select the User you would like to authenticate with. If there are no users to select, create one and make sure to give it the required permissions to read from S3 buckets. If you haven't created an access key pair before, click on "Create access key" to generate a new one. Make sure to copy the Secret Access Key as they are shown only once.
        After selecting the user, go to **Security Credentials** tab and in it you should be able to see the Access keys for that user.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Sign In">
        Log in to your AWS account at [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
      </Step>
      <Step title="External ID">
        The ARN is going to need an external ID which will be required during the configuration of the S3 source connector. The external ID will allow us to reach out to you S3 buckets and read data from it.
        You can generate an external Id using this [GUID generator tool](https://guidgenerator.com/). [Learn more about AWS STS external ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html).

### Step 2: Locate AWS S3 Configuration Details

Now you should be in the AWS and have found your credentials. Now we will navigate to the S3 service to find the necessary configuration details:

1. **IAM User Access Key and Secret Access Key or IAM Role ARN and External ID:**
   - This has been gathered from the previous step.

2. **Bucket:**
   - Once inside of the AWS S3 console you should be able to see the list of buckets available, if not go ahead and create a bucket by clicking on the "Create bucket" button.

3. **Region:**
   - In the same list showing the buckets, there's a region assotiated with it.

4. **Path:**
   - The path where the file you wish to read from. This field is optional and can be left blank.

5. **File type:**
   - The files within the path that was selected should help determine the file type.

### Step 3: Configure S3 Connector in Your Application

Now that you have gathered all the necessary details enter the following information:
   - **Region:** The AWS region where your S3 bucket resources are located.
   - **Access Key ID:** Your AWS IAM user's Access Key ID.
   - **Secret Access Key:** The corresponding Secret Access Key.
   - **Bucket:** The name of the bucket you want to use.
   - **Path:** The path directory where the files are located at.
   - **File type:** The type of file (csv, parquet).

### Step 4: Test the S3 Connection

After configuring the connector in your application:

1. Save the configuration settings.
2. Test the connection to S3 from your application to ensure everything is set up correctly.
3. Run a test query or check the connection status to verify successful connectivity.

Your S3 connector is now configured and ready to query data from your S3 data catalog.

## Building a Model Query

The S3 source connector is powered by [DuckDB S3 api support](https://duckdb.org/docs/extensions/httpfs/s3api.html). This allows us to use 
SQL queries to describe and/or fetch data from an S3 bucket, for example:
```
SELECT * FROM 's3://my-bucket/path/to/file/file.parquet';
```

From the example, we can notice some details that are required in order to perform the query:
   - **FROM command: `'s3://my-bucket/path/to/file/file.parquet'`** You need to provide a value in the same format as the example.
   - **Bucket: `my-bucket`** In that format you will need to provide the bucket name. The bucket name needs to be
   the same one provided when configuring the S3 source connector.
   - **Path: `/path/to/file`** In that format you will need to provide the path to the file. The path needs to be
   the same one provided when configuring the S3 source connector.
   - **File name and type: `file.parquet`** In that format you will need to provide the file name and type at the end of the path. The file type needs to be
   the same one provided when configuring the S3 source connector.
