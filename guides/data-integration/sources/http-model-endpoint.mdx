## Step 3: Configure HTTP Connection Details
    
  Enter the following information to set up your HTTP connection:
  
  - **URL**: The URL where your model resides.
  - **Headers**: Any required headers as key-value pairs, such as authentication tokens or content types.
  - **Timeout**: The maximum time, in seconds, to wait for a response from the server before the request is canceled

## Step 4: Test the Connection
  Use the **Test Connection** feature to ensure that AI Squared can connect to your HTTP Model endpoint. If the test is successful, youâ€™ll receive a confirmation message. If not, review your connection details.

## Step 5: Save the Connector Settings
  Once the connection test is successful, save the connector settings to establish the destination.
