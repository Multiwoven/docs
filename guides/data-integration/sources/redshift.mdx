## Overview

Amazon Redshift connector is built on top of JDBC and is based on the [Redshift JDBC driver](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/configure-jdbc-connection.html). It allows you to connect to your Redshift data warehouse and extract data for further processing and analysis.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the necessary Redshift credentials available, including the endpoint (host), port, database name, user, and password. You might also need appropriate permissions to create connections and execute queries within your Redshift cluster.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Connect Amazon Redshift

### Step 1: Navigate to the Sources Section

Begin by accessing your Multiwoven dashboard. From there:

1. Click on the Setup menu found on the sidebar.
2. Select the `Sources` section to proceed.

### Step 2: Add Redshift as a New Source

Within the Sources section:

1. Find and click on the `Add Source` button.
2. From the list of data warehouse options, select **Amazon Redshift**.

### Step 3: Enter Redshift Credentials

You will be prompted to enter the credentials for your Redshift cluster. This includes:

**`Endpoint (Host)`** The URL of your Redshift cluster endpoint.

**`Port`** The port number used by your Redshift cluster (default is 5439).

**`Database Name`** The name of the database you wish to connect.

**`User`** Your Redshift username.

**`Password`** Your Redshift password.

<Warning>Make sure to enter these details accurately to ensure a successful connection.</Warning>

### Step 4: Test the Connection

Before finalizing the connection:

Click on the `Test Connection` button. This step verifies that Multiwoven can successfully connect to your Redshift cluster with the provided credentials.

### Step 5: Finalize Your Redshift Source Connection

After a successful connection test:

1. Assign a name and a brief description to your Redshift source. This helps in identifying and managing your source within Multiwoven.
2. Click `Save` to complete the setup process.

### Step 6: Configure Redshift User Permissions

<Note>It is recommended to create a dedicated user with read-only access to the tables you want to query. Ensure that the new user has the necessary permissions to access the required tables and views.</Note>
    
    ```sql
    CREATE USER multiwoven PASSWORD 'password';
    GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO multiwoven;
    GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO multiwoven;
    ```


Your Amazon Redshift data warehouse is now connected to Multiwoven. You can now start creating models and running queries on your Redshift data.
